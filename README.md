                <p style="color: black; text-align: justify;">Hi! My name is Ashley, and I'm back in school—though I'm still figuring out how I got here! After graduating from the University of Central Florida with a degree in Hospitality Management, I quickly pivoted to earn a degree in Early Childhood Education. I spent seven rewarding years teaching in a day school, where my proudest achievement was building an elementary program from the ground up. It was hard work, but the best kind! I hand-selected all the curriculum and supplemental materials for my project-based learning program, and I have a hunch that all that curriculum planning brought me back to school.</p>
				
				<p style="color: black; text-align: justify;">After five glorious years as a K-2 elementary teacher in the BEST classroom, life took an unexpected turn. The program was downsizing, and my teaching contract wasn’t renewed—definitely a story for another day! Feeling blindsided and like my identity had been ripped away, I explored graduate schools while searching for a new job, specifically in Instructional Design. After some research, I decided it would be wise to find a job before diving into any school debt.</p>
				
				<p style="color: black; text-align: justify;">
To my surprise, I landed a role at the University of Florida's MBA Program as the Education and Training Specialist! For the last two years, I've been involved in—and am now leading—the development of the training and development curriculum for nearly 900 MBA students. No pressure, right? This new role has pushed me to grow both personally and professionally, and I absolutely love it. I've discovered that creating curriculum and enhancing student learning are true passions of mine—likely how I ended up in grad school. Plus, grad school is a fantastic way to enhance the work I'm doing!</p>
				
				<p style="color: black; text-align: justify;">I'm currently working my way through my Master's in Education with an emphasis on Instructional Design. I'm taking it at a pace that works for me and anticipate graduating in May of 2026, but who knows? I’m taking this one day at a time, with two classes a semester. I’m hopeful to learn a lot along the way.  :) </p>
